# Project Overview

## ❓ The Problem: DeFi Stress & Complexity

DeFi offers high yields, but managing positions across multiple lending protocols (Venus, Kinza, Radiant) on BNB Chain is exhausting and risky.
-   **Anxiety-Inducing**: Users constantly check their phones, fearing liquidation volatility.
-   **Fragmented**: Toggling between multiple dApps to monitor health factors is inefficient.
-   **Complex**: Executing "looping" strategies manually is prone to human error.

## 💡 The Solution: OpButler

**OpButler - Your Personal DeFi Concierge.** 
We built an intelligent interface that prioritizes **"Good Vibes Only"**. It aggregates your positions and uses a Gemini-powered AI agent to monitor them 24/7.

-   **[x] Unified Portfolio Manager**: Supply, borrow, and manage yields across **Venus, Kinza, and Radiant** in one beautiful, stress-free dashboard.
-   **[x] AI Risk Agent (Gemini)**: A Telegram Bot that understands your portfolio. It provides **natural language insights** on how to optimize your position and sends proactive **Risk Alerts** before you get rekt.
-   **[x] Strategy Simulator**: Architect complex "Smart Loop" strategies and visualize risk scenarios *before* you commit funds.
-   **[x] Visual Health Indicators**: Simple, color-coded status checks (Safe/Warning/Danger) mean you can check your financial health in seconds.

## 🌍 Impact

OpButler democratizes advanced DeFi strategies for the average user on BNB Chain. By abstracting away the complexity of risk management and using AI to watch the markets, we lower the barrier to entry and safeguard user funds against volatility.
