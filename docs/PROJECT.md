# Project Overview

## ❓ The Problem

DeFi offers high yields, but managing positions across multiple lending protocols (Venus, Kinza, Radiant) on BNB Chain is complex and risky.
-   **Fragmentation**: Users have to toggle between multiple dApps to monitor their health factors.
-   **Liquidation Risk**: Volatile markets can lead to sudden liquidations if users aren't constantly watching.
-   **Complex Strategies**: Executing "looping" strategies (supply -> borrow -> supply) manually is tedious and error-prone.

## 💡 The Solution

**OpButler** acts as your personal DeFi optimization butler. It aggregates your positions and uses an AI agent to monitor them 24/7.
-   [x] **Unified Portfolio Manager**: Supply, borrow, and manage yields across **Venus, Kinza, and Radiant** all in one app. No more tab-switching.
-   [x] **AI Risk Guard**: A Telegram Agent that monitors your health 24/7. It sends instant **Risk Alerts** and provides **AI-driven suggestions** (e.g., "Repay 5 BNB to avoid liquidation") to keep you safe.
-   [x] **Strategy Architect**: Build and simulate complex **Smart Loop** strategies. Visualize potential APY and risk scenarios *before* execution.
-   [x] **Yield Dashboard**: Real-time view of your net worth, net APY, and liquidation proximity.

## 🌍 Impact

OpButler democratizes advanced DeFi strategies for the average user on BNB Chain. By abstracting away the complexity of risk management and strategy execution, it encourages deeper liquidity participation while safeguarding user funds against market volatility.
