# Project Overview

## ❓ The Problem

DeFi offers high yields, but managing positions across multiple lending protocols (Venus, Kinza, Radiant) on BNB Chain is complex and risky.
-   **Fragmentation**: Users have to toggle between multiple dApps to monitor their health factors.
-   **Liquidation Risk**: Volatile markets can lead to sudden liquidations if users aren't constantly watching.
-   **Complex Strategies**: Executing "looping" strategies (supply -> borrow -> supply) manually is tedious and error-prone.

## 💡 The Solution

**OpButler** acts as your personal DeFi optimization butler. It aggregates your positions and uses an AI agent to monitor them 24/7.
-   **Unified Dashboard**: One place to view and manage all your BNB Chain lending positions.
-   **Telegram AI Agent**: A bot that sends you instant alerts on health degradation and allows you to query your portfolio status via natural language.
-   **One-Click Strategies**: Pre-packaged, risk-assessed looping strategies to leverage your assets safely.
-   **Risk Monitor**: A dedicated system that visualizes your proximity to liquidation and suggests actions.

## 🌍 Impact

OpButler democratizes advanced DeFi strategies for the average user on BNB Chain. By abstracting away the complexity of risk management and strategy execution, it encourages deeper liquidity participation while safeguarding user funds against market volatility.
